*option to go fullscreen
*two item toggle    windowed mode  ( fullscreen|windowed )

*Find maximum scaling direction while maintaining aspect ratio ( for windowed and full-screen )
*use logical coords to define render pos
*move level rendering into one function that all use
*Stop crashing if seleciton outside level bound ( just dont select anything)
*Translate mouse pos to logical coordinates
*Load souns with rodio
*play click with rodio   ( try play_once )
*Fix the gem counter so the same gem is only counted once
*Play gem hit sound
*Show ray before dropping ( and play the effect )
*Enlarge the picked up piece
*Create scale abut that scales a rectangle defined with (tl, and size ) 
*Add gem glow
*Create separate instance of tile batched with glow glsl
*Add gem vibrate when hit
*transitions
*-fade to white when play selected
*-- rebuild to show the entire ray when solved
*-- display solution for seconds before moving to next screen
*-- fade out after solution shown ( increase ray brightness, -> fade to white? )
*-tile punch
* tile tickle when moving over movable tile
* Level Complete text flies in and out ( overlap flying and fading)
* Level Number text flies in and out ( overlap flying and fading)
* Back from the main menu does not always work. It goes into a game when going back instead of the main menu - Fixed
* Save progress and Settings - save calledmultiple times - make sure called once only
* Better message passing. opening new max level good example of complexity that seems unnecessary. Better to call directly into config?/// or have better message posting
* Glyph brush params to be updated when screen resolution changes to enable scissoring
* Same scissoring to be used by other renderers

Fix level with one teleported only ( Find full set of levels )
- Tidy up sequencing
-- Hide tile pieces and ray on level show ( and dont let them react to controls )
-- Show solution faster ( in chunks ) but only start counter when complete solution is shown

Tidy up menus
-- Scroll for 

- add solution transition 
- 'Pling' movable piece on show level at the beinning of Level -> Needs a better effect

- Nicer ray
-   Render polygonal animating ray
-   pushes/punches tile pieces when they ray hits them (  maybe pull nboring touching pieces)
-   expand when level complete

Bugs
- CHanging resolution / or going to in-game menu messes up the tile effect ( they disappear ) - Cant repro  ---> FIxed
- THe option selector ( full-screen/windowed does not show the actual selection) --> Fixed


Add clipping to hide bits outside logical page ( Using scissor rectangle)

Add audio effects
- hum that fades out when ray changes 
- Add option to render background only for front

Rescale
- Scaling looks ugly in some instances  and needs stepping in of tex coords to avoid. Can we make it unnecessary by limiting scale sizes




Load settngs and progress

Settings page
- turn off audio 

Need a selection UI items
- text line
- slider ( audio volume )
